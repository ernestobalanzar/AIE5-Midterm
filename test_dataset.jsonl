Many caregiving questions relate more to \nnursing than to medicine.  In particular, the nurse can answer questions \nabout various tests and examinations, preparing for surgical procedures, \nproviding personal care, and managing medications at home.  \n\u2022 Make sure your appointment meets your needs.
