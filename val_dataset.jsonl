Recognize warning signs early.  These might include irritability, sleep \nproblems, and forgetfulness.  Know your own warning signs, and act to \nmake changes.

Ask yourself, \"What is causing stress for \nme?\"  Sources of stress might be too much to do, family disagreements, \nfeelings of inadequacy, inability to say no.  \n3. Identify what you can and cannot change. Remember, we can only \nchange ourselves; we cannot change another person.  When you try to \nchange things over which you have no control, you will only increase \nyour sense of frustration.  Ask yourself, \"What do I have some control \nover?

Stress reducers can be simple activities like walking \nand other forms of exercise, gardening, meditation, having coffee with a \nfriend. Identify some stress reducers that work for you. \n \nTool #2: Setting Goals \nSetting goals or deciding what you would like to accomplish in the next \nthree to six months is an important tool for taking care of yourself.

Once you've identified a problem, taking \naction to solve it can change the situation and also change your attitude to \na more positive one, giving you more confidence in your abilities. \n \nSteps for Seeking Solutions \n1. Identify the problem.  Look at the situation with an open mind.  The real \nproblem might not be what first comes to mind.  For example, you think \nthat the problem is simply that you are tired all the time, when the more", "2b4dc6e0-983a-49ba-8dba-162f579d38b5": "basic difficulty is your belief that \"no one can care for John like I can.\" \nThe problem?

Call Family Caregiver \nAlliance or the Eldercare Locator (see Resources List) and ask about \nagencies in your area that could help provide care.  \n3. Select one solution from the list.  Then try it!  \n4. Evaluate the results.  Ask yourself how well your choice worked.  \n5. Try a second solution.  If your first idea didn't work, select another.  But \ndon't give up on the first; sometimes an idea just needs fine tuning.  \n6. Use other resources.

You can revisit it at another time.  \n \nNote: All too often, we jump from step one to step seven and then feel \ndefeated and stuck.  Concentrate on keeping an open mind while listing \nand experimenting with possible solutions \n \nTool #4: Communicating Constructively \nBeing able to communicate constructively is one of a caregiver's most \nimportant tools.  When you communicate in ways that are clear, assertive \nand constructive, you will be heard and get the help and support you need. \nThe box below shows basic guidelines for good communication.", "f1480d7f-d8a7-46dc-b66c-3e644b1e3a43": "6 \nCommunication Guidelines \n\u2022 Use \"I\" messages rather than \"you\" messages.  Saying \"I feel angry\" \nrather than \"You made me angry\" enables you to express your feelings \nwithout blaming others or causing them to become defensive.  \n\u2022 Respect the rights and feelings of others.  Do not say something that will \nviolate another person's rights or intentionally hurt the person's feelings.   \nRecognize that the other person has the right to express feelings.  \n\u2022 Be clear and specific.  Speak directly to the person.  Don't hint or hope \nthe person will guess what you need.  Other people are not mind \nreaders.  When you speak directly about what you need or feel, you are \ntaking the risk that the other person might disagree or say no to your \nrequest, but that action also shows respect for the other person's", "1125a72f-290b-4ea0-90d5-c937062b0dbd": "opinion.

You may \nnot wish to \"burden\" others or admit that you can't handle everything \nyourself. \n \nBe prepared with a mental list of ways that others could help you.  For \nexample, someone could take the person you care for on a 15- minute walk \na couple of times a week . Your neighbor could pick up a few things for you \nat the grocery store.

Don't wait until you are overwhelmed and \nexhausted or your health fails.  Reaching out for help when you need it is a \nsign of personal strength. \n \nTips on How to Ask \n\u2022 Consider the person's special abilities and interests.  If you know a \nfriend enjoys cooking but dislikes driving, your chances of getting help \nimprove if you ask for help with meal preparation.  \n\u2022 Resist asking the same person repeatedly.

A person \nwho is tired and stressed might not be available to help out.   Wait for a \nbetter time.  \n\u2022 Prepare a list of things that need doing.  The list might include errands, \nyard work, a visit with your loved one.  Let the \"helper\" choose what she \nwould like to do.  \n\u2022 Be prepared for hesitance or refusal.  It can be upsetting for the \ncaregiver when a person is unable or unwilling to help.  But in the long \nrun, it would do more harm to the relationship if the person helps only \nbecause he doesn't want to upset you.  To the person who seems \nhesitant, simply say, \"Why don't you think about it.\"  Try not to take it \npersonally when a request is turned down.  The person is turning down \nthe task, not you.

Use \"I\" statements to make \nspecific requests: \"I would like to go to church on Sunday.

Some \n77 percent of those caregivers report the need to ask for advice about the \nmedications and medical treatments.  The person they usually turn to is \ntheir physician."}}
