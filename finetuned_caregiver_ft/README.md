  sentences:
  - 'Support for nutrition, breathing, and feeding

    People with ALS may have trouble chewing and swallowing their food, and getting
    the nutrients they need. Nutritionists and registered dieticians can help plan
    small, nutritious meals throughout the day and identify foods to avoid. When the
    person can no longer eat with help, a feeding tube can reduce the person’s risk
    of choking and pneumonia.'

  - "Identifying Personal Barriers \nMany times, attitudes and beliefs form personal\
    \ barriers that stand in the \nway of caring for yourself.  Not taking care of\
    \ yourself may be a lifelong \npattern, with taking care of others an easier option.\
    \  However, as a family \ncaregiver you must ask yourself, \"What good will I\

    \ and overcoming \nobstacles is not an easy proposition, but it can be done –\
    \ regardless of \nyour age or situation.  The first task in removing personal\
    \ barriers to self-\ncare is to identify what is in your way.  For example, \n\
    • Do you feel you have to prove that you are worthy of the care recipient's \n\
    affection?  \n• Do you think you are being selfish if you put your needs first?\
    \  \n• Is it frightening to think of your own needs? What is the fear about?"

    with ALS?
  sentences:
  - 'Eventually, people with ALS will not be able to stand or walk, get in or out
    of bed on their own, use their hands and arms, or breathe on their own. Because
    they usually remain able to reason, remember, and understand, they are aware of
    their progressive loss of function. This can cause anxiety and depression in the
    person with ALS and their loved ones. Although not as common, people with ALS
    also may experience problems with language or decision-making. Some also develop
    a form of dementia known as FTD-ALS.

    Most people with ALS die from being unable to breathe on their own (known as respiratory
    failure,) usually within three to five years from when the symptoms first appear.
    However, about 10% survive for a decade or more.

  - "Caring for a person living with ALS\nAs the person with ALS progresses in their\
    \ disease, they will need more and more help with daily activities. Being a caregiver\
    \ for a person with ALS, while rewarding, can be challenging for the person’s\

    \ and to seek support when needed. Free and paid resources are available to provide\

- source_sentence: How can prospective donors participate in ALS research through
    brain donation?
  sentences:
  - 'Doctors may use the following medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
    Administration (FDA) to support a treatment plan for ALS:'
  - NINDS also supports the NIH NeuroBioBank, a collaborative effort involving several
    brain banks across the U.S. that supply investigators with tissue from people
    with neurological and other disorders. Tissue from individuals with ALS is needed
    to help advance critical research on the disease. A single donated brain can make
    a huge impact on ALS research, potentially providing information for hundreds
    of studies. The goal is to increase the availability of, and access to, high quality
    specimens for research to understand the neurological basis of the disease. Prospective
    donors can begin the enrollment process by visiting Learn How to Become a Brain
    Donor.
  - The National ALS Registry collects, manages, and analyzes de-identified data about
    people with ALS in the United States. Developed by the Center for Disease Control
    and Prevention's Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), this
    registry establishes information about the number of ALS cases, collects demographic,
    occupational, and environmental exposure data from people with ALS to learn about
    potential risk factors for the disease, and notifies participants about research
    opportunities. The Registry includes data from national databases as well as de-identified
    information provided by individuals with ALS. All information is kept confidential.
    People with ALS can add their information to the registry and sign up to receive
    for more information.

Changes in more than a dozen genes have been found to cause familial ALS.</code>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
