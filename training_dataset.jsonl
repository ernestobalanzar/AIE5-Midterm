As motor neurons degenerate and die, they stop sending messages to the muscles, which causes the muscles to weaken, start to twitch (fasciculations), and waste away (atrophy). Eventually, in people with ALS, the brain loses its ability to initiate and control voluntary movements such as walking, talking, chewing and other functions, as well as breathing. ALS is progressive, meaning the symptoms get worse over time.", "eecbceaf-76da-4921-a58b-ca473d108f27": "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved several drugs for ALS that may prolong survival, reduce the rate of decline, or help manage symptoms. However, there is currently no known treatment that stops or reverses the progression of ALS.\nEarly symptoms include:", "46b8f30c-7f55-41f6-bc8d-6e6d1e296ba4": "Muscle twitches in the arm, leg, shoulder, or tongue\nMuscle cramps\nTight and stiff muscles (spasticity)\nMuscle weakness affecting an arm, a leg, or the neck\nSlurred and nasal speech\nDifficulty chewing or swallowing\n\nAs the disease progresses, muscle weakness and atrophy spread to other parts of your body. People with ALS may develop problems with:\n\nChewing food and swallowing (dysphagia)\nDrooling (sialorrhea)\nSpeaking or forming words (dysarthria)\nBreathing (dyspnea)\nUnintended crying, laughing, or other emotional displays (pseudobulbar symptoms)\nConstipation\nMaintaining weight and getting enough nutrients", "25431f51-8c12-4c01-8eca-47ed4b7a96c7": "Eventually, people with ALS will not be able to stand or walk, get in or out of bed on their own, use their hands and arms, or breathe on their own. Because they usually remain able to reason, remember, and understand, they are aware of their progressive loss of function. This can cause anxiety and depression in the person with ALS and their loved ones. Although not as common, people with ALS also may experience problems with language or decision-making. Some also develop a form of dementia known as FTD-ALS.\nMost people with ALS die from being unable to breathe on their own (known as respiratory failure,) usually within three to five years from when the symptoms first appear. However, about 10% survive for a decade or more.\nWho is more likely to get amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)?", "9c3313e2-67df-40c5-a235-a74647a49a04": "A risk factor is a condition or behavior that occurs more frequently in those who have a disease, or who are at greater risk of getting a disease, than in those who don't have the risk factor.

Possible risk factors for veterans include exposure to lead, pesticides, and other environmental toxins. Some studies have also shown that head injury can be associated with higher risk for ALS, but more research is needed to understand this connection. \nSporadic and Familial ALS\nNearly all cases of\u00a0ALS\u00a0are considered sporadic, meaning the disease seems to occur at random with no clearly associated risk factors and no family history of the disease.

This childhood form is linked to the gene SPTLC1 that is part of the body's fat production system and may be caused by changes in the way the body metabolizes fatty materials (lipids).\nHow is amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) diagnosed and treated?\nDiagnosing ALS\nIt is important to get an accurate ALS diagnosis as soon as possible.

In some cases, a spinal tap (lumbar puncture) may be performed to obtain the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord called cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for additional testing.

However, some treatments may slow progression of the disease, improve quality of life, and extend survival. New treatments have become available in the past several years, and researchers continue to explore diverse avenues to slow or stop progression of ALS.\nSupportive health care is best provided by integrated, multi-disciplinary teams of professionals that may include physicians, pharmacists, physical, occupational, speech, and respiratory therapists, nutritionists, social workers, clinical psychologists, and home care and hospice nurses. These teams can design an individualized treatment plan and provide special equipment aimed at keeping people as mobile, comfortable, and independent as possible.", "1b78d846-4b41-4892-9e55-75771b420b5c": "Doctors may use the following medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to support a treatment plan for\u00a0ALS:", "f4b7cadd-f84e-4c83-9630-975cf2c7a096": "Riluzole (Rilutek) is an oral medication believed to reduce damage to motor neurons by decreasing levels of glutamate, which transports messages between nerve cells and motor neurons.
